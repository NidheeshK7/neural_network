# Neural Network Framework

This framework provides a simple, customizable implementation of a neural network from scratch using NumPy. It includes essential components for building, training, and evaluating neural networks, such as layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.

## Features

- **Linear Layer**: Implements a fully connected layer.
- **Activation Functions**:
  - ReLU
  - Sigmoid
  - Tanh
  - Softmax
- **Loss Functions**:
  - Cross-Entropy Loss
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss
- **Optimizer**:
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- **Model Class**:
  - Add layers, compile, train, predict, evaluate, save, and load models.

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine. Ensure you have Python installed with NumPy and pandas:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
